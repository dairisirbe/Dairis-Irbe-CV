## Executive summary
* I'm passionate about electronics, mechatronics, RC aircraft building
* My passion is to design and practically develop complex design solutions
* I pay close attention to accuracy
* About me in a few words: positive, technically minded, committed

## About me

I am a 2nd year student at Riga Technical University program "Mechanical and Instrumental Engineering", I live in Sigulda, Latvia.

I have been engaged in technical hobby - RC aircraft building for 10 years. I try to promote this activity in Latvia, often participating in various aviation-related events.

In addition to RC aerplanes, I am passionate about electronics, robotics - I design, build, program various robots and participate in Latvian and international competitions, and also I work as a teacher at the [Sigulda Creativity center](https://www.facebook.com/SiguldasJC/) to pass on my knowledge about electronics and robotics to children.

# Robotics

I am [SIG - robotics and mechatronics](https://www.facebook.com/SIGsquad/) member.

### Folkrace

Folkrace is a robotics discipline in which the main task of a robot is to avoid and overcome various obstacles. I have grown from very primitive to quite complex solutions, which include development of specialized PCBs, CNC milling, 3D modeling, programming.

In the most recent robot design, I have created a special gear system and custom BLDC (brushless) motor controllers for the robot, which allow the motors to develop maximum power at speeds close to zero.

For several years in a row, I have won prizes in the Latvian [Robotics Championship](http://robotuskola.lv/lv/latvijas-robotikas-cempionats-kalendars/) and the world's largest robotics competition [Robotex International](https://robotex.international).

### Drone race

Drone race is a robotics discipline that combines several challenges. It is necessary to create an unmanned aircraft that is able to take off, land and fly autonomously based on markers around it.

The idea for such drone originated already in 2017, but after several prototypes, I abandoned it. At the end of 2019 I committed myself to try once again.
* Using a CNC router, I created a drone body
* With Arduino IDE I created a specialized drone stabilization algorithm
* Created a machine vision algorithm that executes on Rpaspbbery PI
* Connected all these components together

This is how my autonomous drone was built.

With the drone I participated in Robotex 2019 competitions and [RTU electronics days](https://www.sigulda.lv/public/lat/jaunumi/18191/). The project is still in progress and I plan to participate in Robotex next year as well.

# RC planes

RC plane building has been a hobby I have been doing for a long time. In doing so, I have practically built various models, acquired knowledge about different materials and about unmanned aircraft in general.

The pictures show the construction process of my aircraft model.

I currently own one of the largest aerobatic RC plane in Latvia. It has a 123 cubic centimeter internal combustion engine and its wingspan is 2.76 meters.
